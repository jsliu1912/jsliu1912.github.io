Since high school, I have been passionate about the charming intricacies of evolution and ecological dynamics that shape the present biodiversity. This natural passion has motivated me to seek a better understanding and sustainable solutions for preserving biological resources.

I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Life Science from National Taiwan University. My thesis, supervised by Professors Chih-Hao Hsieh, focused on exploring the trait-mediated spatiotemporal dynamics of fish populations in the North Sea to understand which traits make fishes more vulnerable to external stressors. Additionally, I engaged in phylogenetic reconstruction using molecular markers to gain a better understanding of deep-sea fish biodiversity in the southwest Pacific Ocean.

As a master's student at the University of Hohenheim, I have been investigating the topics with broad relevance to evolutionary genomics. One of them was about crop domestication, I conducted a mini-project during the course “Plant Genetic Resource” to explore the evolutionary histories of maize via simulated data. Moreover, I worked as an intern to characterize the somatic mutations conferring chemotherapy resistance in cancer cells via single-cell RNA-seq data in Professor Dr. Benedikt Brors’ lab in German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ). Currently, I am working on my master's thesis in Professor Dr. Philipp Schlüter’s lab, where I am exploring the evolutionary mechanisms that underlie rapid pollinator-driven speciation among sympatric bee orchids.

In my leisure time, I enjoy hiking, wildlife observation, playing badminton and cooking.
